Your task is to desing a UI kit in pure html with tailwind css, in order to make the task of designing pages easier. What you're going to do is this: 

- Generate a component 
- Put the component next to a code block (the code block must be copiable)
- All components must be responsive for monitors, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. 
- All componnets must be reuasble withouth a small bit of change. 

## The components

- Navbar 
- Navbar with logo 
- Navbar with links
    - Navbar with links, one of them is a button (for sing up/sign in or accessing an app)
- Hero sections (at least 5 different types of hero sections)
- Hero sections with image background
- Hero sections with call to actions 
- Cards 
- Forms 
- Buttons (primary button, secondary button, warning button, success button, danger button)
- Footers (at least 3 different types of footers)

## Additional notes 

For responsiveness of the navbars, we need to put al the links in to a hamburger menu on the navbar. Consider writing javascript code for this matter.
